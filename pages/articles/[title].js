                Cats are one of the best pets you can get. If you are hesitant
                to take on the responsibility of owning a pet, you might want to
                look again at the benefits of having a cat. They are sweet,
                quiet and independent, and hearing a cat’s purr can melt your
                heart. Here are the top five reasons you should own a cat.

              <h2>Cats can bathe themselves</h2>
              <p>
                Cats are clean pretty much 100 percent of the time. That means
                you never have to take the time out of your day to perform the
                somewhat painstaking task of washing and grooming your cat.
              </p>

              <h2>Cats will keep your house and yard rodent-free</h2>
              <p>
                If you are not a fan of rats, chipmunk, voles or mice in your
                home, owning a cat will take care of that right away. Your cat
                may even bring you its prize to make you proud!
              </p>

              <h2>Cats are low-maintenance and independent</h2>
              <p>
                If you think you do not have the time or energy to own a pet,
                then a cat could be perfect for you. Taking care of a cat
                requires less responsibility than some other animals. Those who
                have full-time jobs can rest easy, knowing that their kitty can
                take care of itself for the most part. And when you do have
                extra time, cuddling up with your cat will feel better than
                ever.
              </p>

              <h2>Cats are an eco-friendly pet choice</h2>
              <p>
                Living a “green” lifestyle can be difficult, but a cat is a
                great choice for potential pet owners looking to stay
                eco-friendly. Studies show that the lifetime resources needed to
                feed and care for a cat have a smaller carbon footprint than for
                other animals. Plus, most cats prefer fish to beef or corn,
                which is better for the environment. You can feel good about
                owning your kitty.
              </p>

              <h2>Cats can help reduce stress</h2>
              <p>
                We all get stressed out, and people have many different ways of
                relieving their stress. Cat owners can reduce tensions by just
                stroking their furry friend’s head. Petting a cat releases
                endorphins into the brain, which makes you happier. Also, cats
                have the softest fur!
              </p>

                  There are so many more reasons that you should get a cat to
                  fill your home with love. Check out your local shelter to find
                  a kitty that really needs a home.
